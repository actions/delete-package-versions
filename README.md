# Delete Package Versions

This action deletes versions of a package from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages). This action will only delete a maximum of 99 versions in one run.

_This action does currently not support deleting packages from the GitHub Container Registry. As the npm registry is about to be migrated to the same new architecture as GHCR, this action won't work for npm soon too (see [#74](https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions/issues/74))._

### What It Can Do

* Create a retention policy (delete all except n most recent pre-release versions)
* Delete all package versions except n most recent versions
* Delete oldest version(s)
* Ignore version(s) from deletion through regex
* Delete version(s) of a package that is hosted in the same repo that is executing the workflow
* Delete version(s) of a package that is hosted in a different repo than the one executing the workflow
* Delete a single version
* Delete multiple versions
* Delete specific version(s)

# Usage

```yaml
- uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v3
  with:
  # Can be a single package version id, or a comma separated list of package version ids.
  # Defaults to an empty string.
  package-version-ids:

  # Owner of the repo hosting the package.
  # Defaults to the owner of the repo executing the workflow.
  # Required if deleting a version from a package hosted in a different repo than the one executing the workflow.
  owner:

  # Repo hosting the package.
  # Defaults to the repo executing the workflow.
  # Required if deleting a version from a package hosted in a different repo than the one executing the workflow.
  repo:

  # Name of the package.
  # Defaults to an empty string.
  # Required if `package-version-ids` input is not given.
  package-name:

  # The number of old versions to delete starting from the oldest version.
  # Defaults to 1.
  num-old-versions-to-delete:

  # The number of latest versions to keep.
  # This cannot be specified with `num-old-versions-to-delete`. By default, `num-old-versions-to-delete` takes precedence over `min-versions-to-keep`.
  # When set to 0, all deletable versions will be deleted.
  # When set greater than 0, all deletable package versions except the specified number will be deleted.
  min-versions-to-keep:

  # The package versions to exclude from deletion.
  # Takes regex for the version name as input.
  # By default nothing is ignored.
  ignore-versions:

  # If true it will delete only the pre-release versions.
  # The number of pre-release versions to keep can be set by using `min-versions-to-keep` value with this.
  # When `min-versions-to-keep` is 0, all pre-release versions get deleted.
  # Defaults to false.
  # Cannot be used with `num-old-versions-to-delete` and `ignore-versions`.
  delete-only-pre-release-versions:

  # The token used to authenticate with GitHub Packages.
  # Defaults to github.token.
  # Required if deleting a version from a package hosted in a different repo than the one executing the workflow.
  #   If `package-version-ids` is given the token only needs the delete packages scope.
  #   If `package-version-ids` is not given the token needs the delete packages scope and the read packages scope
  token:
```

# Valid Input Combinations

`owner`, `repo`, `package-name` and `token` can be used with the following combinations in a workflow - 

  - `num-old-versions-to-delete`
  - `min-versions-to-keep` 
  - `delete-only-pre-release-versions`
  - `ignore-versions`
  - `num-old-versions-to-delete` + `ignore-versions`
  - `min-versions-to-keep` + `ignore-versions`
  - `min-versions-to-keep` + `delete-only-pre-release-versions`

  ### Delete all pre-release versions except y latest pre-release package versions

  To delete all pre release versions except y latest pre-release package versions in the same repo as the workflow the __package-name__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __delete-only-pre-release-versions__ inputs are required.

  __Example__

  Delete all pre-release package versions except latest 10 in the same repo as the workflow

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v3
    with: 
      package-name: 'test-package'
      min-versions-to-keep: 10
      delete-only-pre-release-versions: "true"
  ```
  To delete all pre release versions except y latest pre-release package versions in a different repo than the workflow the __owner__, __repo__, __package-name__, __token__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __delete-only-pre-release-versions__ inputs are required.

  The [token][token] needs the delete packages and read packages scope. It is recommended [to store the token as a secret][secret]. In this example the [token][token] was stored as a secret named __GITHUB_PAT__.

  __Example__

  Delete all pre-release package versions except latest 10 in a different repo than the workflow

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v3
    with: 
      owner: 'github'
      repo: 'packages'
      package-name: 'test-package'
      token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_PAT }}
      min-versions-to-keep: 10
      delete-only-pre-release-versions: "true"
  ```

      package-name: 'test-package'
      min-versions-to-keep: 3
      ignore-versions: '^(0|[1-9]\\d*)\\.0\\.0$'
  ```

  To delete all except y latest versions while ignoring particular package versions in a different repo than the workflow the __owner__, __repo__, __package-name__, __token__, __min-versions-to-keep__ and __ignore-versions__ inputs are required.

  The [token][token] needs the delete packages and read packages scope. It is recommended [to store the token as a secret][secret]. In this example the [token][token] was stored as a secret named __GITHUB_PAT__.

  __Example__

  ### Delete oldest x number of versions while ignoring particular package versions

  To delete oldest x number of versions while ignoring all the major package versions in the same repo as the workflow the __package-name__, __num-oldest-versions-to-delete__ and __ignore-versions__ inputs are required.

  There is a possibility if the oldest x number of versions contain ignored package versions, actual package versions to get deleted will be less than x.

  __Example__

  Delete 3 oldest versions excluding major versions as per semver is the same repo as the workflow

  ```yaml
  - uses: actions/delete-package-versions@v3
